- programs: represents the remaining candidate meetings. This defines the remaining search space.
- timeLine: the earliest allowed start time for the next meeting. This enforces non\-overlap.
- done: an accumulator for how many meetings have been scheduled so far. It is not strictly necessary to define the subproblem; it just carries the current count.

Minimal sufficient state:
- The subproblem is fully determined by \[programs, timeLine\]. From this state you can compute the best additional count and add it to the current total. Therefore, `done` can be removed and you can return the best count from the current state.

A lean alternative signature:
```java
public static int process(Program[] programs, int timeLine) {
    int max = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < programs.length; i++) {
        if (programs[i].start >= timeLine) {
            Program[] next = copyButExcept(programs, i);
            max = Math.max(max, 1 + process(next, programs[i].end));
        }
    }
    return max;
}
```

Diagram of the recursion tree (example with A\(1,3\), B\(2,4\), C\(3,5\); start at done\=0, timeLine\=0):

```text
process([A,B,C], done=0, time=0)
│
├── pick A (start≥0) → process([B,C], done=1, time=3)
│   │
│   ├── try B (2≥3? no) → skip
│   └── pick C (3≥3) → process([], done=2, time=5) → leaf: 2
│
├── pick B (start≥0) → process([A,C], done=1, time=4)
│   │
│   ├── try A (1≥4? no) → skip
│   └── try C (3≥4? no) → leaf: 1
│
└── pick C (start≥0) → process([A,B], done=1, time=5)
    │
    ├── try A (1≥5? no) → skip
    └── try B (2≥5? no) → leaf: 1
```

Key takeaway:
- Choose parameters that uniquely define the subproblem state. Here, \[remaining meetings, current time\] is sufficient; `done` is optional and can be folded into the return value.
